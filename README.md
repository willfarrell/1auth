# 1auth

Collection of modules to assist in user authentication and session management.

1Auth is like an ORM for `accounts`, `authentications`, `messengers`, `sessions` with extensibility to ensure they have a consistent API and ensure that encoding/decoding/encryption/decryption are applied in a consistent way. All while enforcing industry defaults for cryptographic algorithms with an easy method to keep them up to date.
